#### How To Make Beautiful Software: Frontend Design Patterns

__Abstract__: The frontend world has always been known by its __volatile nature__, however we don't make any effort to abstract ourselves from all that. We should build __robust__ and __long-lived__ software. In this talk we'll see how to tackle common problems in the frontend world using __TypeScript__, __React__ and several __design patterns__. We'll see how we'll make our software _open to change_ while not trying to _guess the future_. Also, we'll appreciate how following the __SOLID principles__ of our app will be very easy to test and change. Are you ready for this journey on _beautiful_ software?

__Topics__: Software architecture
