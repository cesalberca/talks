# Talks

I'm a young programmer very interested in good practices, architecture, testing and SOLID principles. I work at [Autentia](https://www.autentia.com/) as a frontend developer (Vue, React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc) although I have worked a bit in Java and Android. I'm continuously on the lookout for things to read, learn and [share](https://www.adictosaltrabajo.com/author/calberca/). I've talked at [JSDay Madrid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNf1Oos0ZB8&t=1s), Codenares 2018 and 2019, [Ritsi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuykoyC0T74&t=1s) and several internal talks at my company, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFQy-ud8Ec4&t=4477s).

## Talks given

### Codenares 2019

### Ritsi 2018

### Codenares 2018

### JSDay 2018

#### Advanced JavaScript Patterns

**Abstract**: When you tell people you code in JavaScript they usually look down on you. This talk will give you the tools to enlighten those heretics. We'll be entering the world of **design patterns** applied to JavaScript, looking through some of the cutting edge properties of ES6 such as **Proxies** and **default function parameter expressions**, dealing with **objects** and even some examples of **functional programming**. This talk is not allowed for cardiacs.

**Topics**: JavaScript

**Length**: 45 minutes

**Level**: Advanced

**Language**: Spanish

**Video**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNf1Oos0ZB8&t=1s

**Repository**: https://github.com/cesalberca/advanced-javascript-patterns

### Autentia

#### CSS Flexbox and Grid

#### Vue

## Call for papers

### Codemotion Milán 2019

#### How To Make Beautiful Software Again: Frontend Design Patterns

**Abstract**: The frontend world has always been known by its **volatile nature**, however we don't make any effort to abstract ourselves from all that. We should build **robust** and **long-lived** software. In this talk we'll see how to tackle common problems in the frontend world using **TypeScript**, **React** and several **design patterns**. We'll see how we'll make our software _open to change_ while not trying to _guess the future_. Also, we'll appreciate how following the **SOLID principles** of our app will be very easy to test and change. Are you ready for this journey on _beautiful_ software?

**Topics**: Software architecture

**Length**: 40 minutes

**Language**: English

**Level**: Advanced

#### Inversion of Control to Take Back Control

**Abstract**: Inversion of Control (IoC) is a powerful mechanism popularized by **Robert C. Martin** and **Martin Fowler** which makes your code more **reusable**, **extensible** and **testable**. It's tied with one of the **SOLID** principles and following it will give you back **absolute control over your code**.

**Topics**: Software architecture

**Length**: 40 minutes

**Language**: English

**Level**: Advanced

#### TypeScript for JavaScripters: Less typing and more Typing!

**Abstract**: When backend people hear JavaScript, they shudder. When frontend people hear TypeScript, they shudder. Why can't we have the best of both worlds? This talk will heavily demistify the usage of TypeScript and we will show how can we —within a JavaScript context— apply TypeScript to get the best development experience. We'll learn what a type system has to offer us and how we can prevent up to 15% bugs in production. And did I tell you about smart autocompletion when coding? How about capturing errors in compilation time instead of runtime? Better null and undefined handling?  Yes, it's possible!

**Topics**: Software architecture

**Length**: 40 minutes

**Language**: English

**Level**: Beginner
