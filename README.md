## About me

### Description 1

I'm a young programmer very interested in good practices, architecture, testing and SOLID principles. I work at Autentia as a frontend developer (Vue, React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc) although I have worked a bit in Java and Android. I'm continuously on the lookout for things to read, learn and share (https://www.adictosaltrabajo.com/author/calberca/). I've talked at JSDay Madrid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNf1Oos0ZB8&t=1s.

### Description 2

César is a Frontend Software Developer focused in good practices, architecture, testing, SOLID, OOP and DDD. He currently works for Autentia using the latest technologies and has a passion for TypeScript and Kotlin.

#### How To Make Beautiful Software: Frontend Design Patterns

__Abstract__: The frontend world has always been known by its __volatile nature__, however we don't make any effort to abstract ourselves from all that. We should build __robust__ and __long-lived__ software. In this talk we'll see how to tackle common problems in the frontend world using __TypeScript__, __React__ and several __design patterns__. We'll see how we'll make our software _open to change_ while not trying to _guess the future_. Also, we'll appreciate how following the __SOLID principles__ of our app will be very easy to test and change. Are you ready for this journey on _beautiful_ software?
